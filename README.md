We're web and software developer instructors at Waukesha County Technical College and we're psyched to bring you Java Enterprise Edition (java web development) training using the latest technology of the web. In other words, we eat our own dog food. Building a site like this takes time, so please excuse our mess during construction. This could take a while :-)
